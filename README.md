# I Love/Hate Git

I'd love to git good at git, but I dig myself some pretty deep holes. These are notes on how to dig myself out or just avoid digging in the first place.

Based on [ffmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/), [CRALS](http://dd388.github.io/crals/), and [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/)
